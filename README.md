# Undertaker

Undertaker is a gem which finds code that hasn't been used in production environments so that it can be removed.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'undertaker'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install undertaker

## How it works

Undertaker takes advantage of Ruby's ability to dynamically define methods. For each class that you want to track, it dynamically rewrites every method on that class to track its usage. Here's a simplified version of what it does:

```ruby
# Consider a class like this
class Foo
  def bar
    puts "hello world"
  end
end

# Once Undertaker wraps the methods (Part 3 - Enabling it) it might look like this
class Foo
  def bar
    begin
      Undertaker::InstanceMethodWrapper.track_method(Foo, :bar) # Track that this method was called
      Foo.define_method(:bar) do
        puts "hello world"
      end
    rescue
      # To ensure that if Undertaker breaks it doesn't break the existing code
    end
    puts "hello world"
  end
end

# That's how the method looks until it is hit once:
Foo.new.bar

# At this point we know that the method has been hit, so we restore the
# original version of the method.
```

Because Undertaker only records method calls once, the performance overhead at runtime is negligible.

Undertaker only tracks method calls and does not track which code is used inside the method. If that is what you are after, consider looking at [coverband](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband). It can track code usage at a more granular level, but it has its own tradeoffs.

## Usage

There are four steps to using Undertaker:

### Part 1 - Configuration

This is where you tell Undertaker what you want to do. In Rails, the configuration could live in `config/initializers`.

```ruby
Undertaker.configure do |config|
  # Two possible values:
  #   :memory - In-memory storage, not persisted anywhere else. Useful for test environments.
  #   :redis  - Data is stored as a set in Redis so that it is persisted across processes.
  # config.storage = :redis
  # config.storage = :memory

  # If using the `redis` storage option, this needs to be set.
  # config.redis = <instance of a Redis client object>

  # This controls whether Undertaker is enabled for this particular process, and takes either
  # a boolean or a object that responds to `call` that returns a boolean.
  # There is some overhead whenever Undertaker enables itself, so you might not want to enable
  # it on all of your processes.
  # config.allowed = true
  # config.allowed = -> { `hostname`.include?("01") }

  # Undertaker will filter out methods whose source_location matches this regular expression.
  # This is useful for filtering out methods from gems (such as the methods from ActiveRecord::Base)
  # config.ignore_paths = /\/vendor\//

  # A list of classes that Undertaker will monitor method usage on.
  # All descendants of these classes will be included.
  config.classes_to_monitor = [ActiveRecord::Base, ApplicationController]
end
```

### Part 2 - Cache Setup

Before Undertaker can do anything, it needs to calculate and store a list of methods that it's going to track. Call this method from a production console to initialize that database:

```ruby
Undertaker::Initializer.refresh_caches
```

If you add new classes or methods to your code which you want to track, you can call `refresh_caches` again at any time to clear all the accumulated data in Redis and start fresh. Until `refresh_caches` has been called at least once, Undertaker won't do anything.

### Part 3 - Enabling it

Wrap the code that you want to monitor in an `Undertaker.enable` block. Any code inside that block will record method calls in Undertaker's storage when they're called for the first time.

```ruby
Undertaker.enable do
  # Do some stuff
end
```

In Rails controllers, this could look like:
```ruby
around_perform :enable_undertaker

def enable_undertaker
  Undertaker.enable { yield }
end
```

### Part 4 - The Report

Once Undertaker has been running for a while, you can generate a report on what methods have not been called by calling `Undertaker::Report.unused_methods`

**Note**: This report doesn't say that methods are _never_ called, only that they _haven't_ been called. The longer Undertaker runs for, the more confident you can be that the method is unused.

Also, it's possible that some methods are being used, but are only called during the application boot process. Undertaker is unable to track those and may mis-report them as unused.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
